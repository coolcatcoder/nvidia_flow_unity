# nvidia_flow_unity
 A library for unity that implements nvidia flow. (no longer maintained, I have since switched to using nvidia flex)

 ## Intro:
 So basically this library should allow the use of nvidia flow inisde unity! The library is split into 2 parts: The raw side, and the clean side!

 The raw side is full of experimental features, memory leaks, commented out pieces of old code that didn't work, and a whole bunch of other nonsense.

 The clean side is nice and formatted properly. It also contains only what works, meaning no experimental features, and memory management is not done for you. (although I plan to change this in the future)
